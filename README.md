# SQL Practice Project

A simple SQL project demonstrating basic queries for analyzing employee and project data.

## About

This project contains sample database tables and SQL queries I created to practice and demonstrate basic SQL skills. The database includes employees, departments, and projects with relationships between them.

## Database Schema

- **departments** - Company departments and their locations
- **employees** - Employee information including salary and hire date
- **projects** - Company projects with status and dates
- **employee_projects** - Links employees to their assigned projects

## Files

- `create_tables.sql` - Creates the database tables
- `insert_data.sql` - Adds sample data to the tables
- `portfolio_select_examples.sql` - Example queries demonstrating different SQL techniques

## Skills Demonstrated

- Basic SELECT queries with filtering and sorting
- JOIN operations to combine data from multiple tables
- Aggregate functions (COUNT, AVG, MAX, MIN)
- GROUP BY and HAVING clauses
- Subqueries
- CASE statements for conditional logic
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

## How to Use

1. Run `create_tables.sql` to create the tables
2. Run `insert_data.sql` to populate the tables with sample data
3. Try the queries in `portfolio_select_examples.sql` to see the results

## Tools Used

- SQL (works with MySQL, PostgreSQL, or similar databases)
